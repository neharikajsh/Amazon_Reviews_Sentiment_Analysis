A real-world Amazon Reviews dataset to work with to investigate how machine learning techniques can be utilised to predict the the star rating and product’s category. The algorithms used for this task are Logistic Regression and BERT. The basic
purpose of the analysis of review data is to identify the user’s subjectivity
and categorise their opinions into whether it’s a review
about video games or a musical instrument and how many stars
(out of 5) may the user have given for the product. This is the final
report after the completion of carrying out the necessary activities
on a dataset chosen.
